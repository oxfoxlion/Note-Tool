# Work Log - 2026-02-15 (note_tool)

## Summary
- Added whiteboard region feature on board detail page
- Users can draw rectangular regions and assign names
- Added region rename and delete actions directly on board
- Region data is currently persisted in browser localStorage by board ID
- Confirmed this iteration does not write region data to backend/database

## UI/UX
- Board tools now include `Draw region` mode
- In region mode:
  - drag on canvas to create a region rectangle
  - prompt appears to name the region after drawing
- Region label supports:
  - rename (`✎`)
  - delete (`×`)
- Minimum region size guard to avoid accidental tiny regions

## Data Behavior (Current)
- Storage key: `board-regions:{boardId}`
- Load timing: after board data load
- Save timing: whenever region list changes
- Scope: same browser/device only (no cross-device sync)

## Files Touched
- `note_tool/app/(app)/boards/[id]/page.tsx`

## Backend Follow-up (Next Step)
1. Create `board_regions` table (or equivalent model)
2. Add API endpoints:
   - `GET /note_tool/board/{boardId}/regions`
   - `POST /note_tool/board/{boardId}/regions`
   - `PUT /note_tool/board/{boardId}/regions/{regionId}`
   - `DELETE /note_tool/board/{boardId}/regions/{regionId}`
3. Extend frontend API client (`lib/noteToolApi.ts`) for region CRUD
4. Replace localStorage flow with API-backed load/save
5. Add migration and basic validation:
   - region name required
   - positive width/height
   - board ownership/permission check

## Notes
- Existing project lint has unrelated baseline errors in multiple files.
- New region feature is implemented, but database persistence is pending backend work.
